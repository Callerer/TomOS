# TomOS
Welcome to TomOS this is a webos based on retro macintosh machines i've made multiple apps for this webOS such as: functioning games, a functioning text editor, functioning calculator. I've also added the option to change the logo and background, and in the taskbar is a file manager, a working realtime clock, and a settings button!

## Cal ops:
issues found:
- wasd keys in any applications triggering snake game
- the input isn't diabled, so input can be given by keyboard (but heck "=" doesn't work, hence not a calc anymore)
- once input by keyboard, the calculator doesn't function anymore, even if you close n re-open (only relaoding the page helps)
- - calculator has no remove button/backspace (hence keyboard input is unavoidable)
