# TomOS
Welcome to TomOS this is a webos based on retro macintosh machines i've made multiple apps for this webOS such as: functioning games, a functioning text editor, functioning calculator. I've also added the option to change the logo and background, and in the taskbar is a file manager, a working realtime clock, and a settings button!
